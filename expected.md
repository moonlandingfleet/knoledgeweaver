# Knowledge Weaver - Expected Functionality

## Project Overview
Knowledge Weaver is a persona-driven document editing application powered by Google Gemini AI. The application allows users to create AI personas based on uploaded documents, and then use these personas to edit documents with contextual awareness of both the persona and the knowledge base.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Persona Creation and Management
- **Auto-generation from Documents**: Users can upload documents and automatically generate a persona based on the content
- **Persona Calibration**: Personas can be calibrated to refine their personality traits, values, and expertise
- **Persona Evolution**: Personas evolve as new documents are added to their knowledge base
- **Persona Storage**: Personas are saved locally and can be managed through the Persona Manager

### 2. Knowledge Base Management
- **Multi-format Document Support**: Supports PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, JSON, TXT, and MD files
- **Document Processing**: Extracts text content and analyzes key concepts, themes, and relationships
- **Knowledge Quality Assessment**: Rates documents based on clarity, accuracy, and relevance
- **Source Tracking**: Maintains connections between persona traits and source documents

### 3. Document Editing with AI
- **Segment-based Editing**: Users can select portions of a document and provide editing instructions
- **Section-based Editing**: Users can work with structured documents and edit specific sections
- **Persona Integration**: Edits are performed through the lens of the selected persona
- **Knowledge Context**: The AI considers the knowledge base when making edits
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each edit comes with a confidence score and reasoning
- **Prompt-based Generation**: Users can generate content from specific prompts based on uploaded documents
- **Influence Weighting**: Users can control how much personality, knowledge, and document context influence the AI's responses

### 4. Feedback-Driven Learning
- **Edit Rating System**: Users can rate edits on a 1-5 star scale
- **Detailed Feedback**: Users can provide written feedback on edits
- **Learning System**: The application tracks ratings to improve future edit suggestions
- **Quality Metrics**: Tracks clarity, accuracy, relevance, and persona alignment

### 5. Advanced Features
- **Selective Pathway Processing**: Users can select specific knowledge pathways for targeted processing
- **Document Evolution Tracking**: Maintains a history of document changes and improvements
- **Document Versioning**: Git-like version control for tracking document evolution
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provides insights into usage patterns, quality metrics, and performance
- **AI Guidance**: Offers development suggestions based on persona evolution and document history

## User Workflow

1. **Create or Select a Persona**
   - Upload documents to the knowledge base
   - Auto-generate a persona from documents or create manually
   - Calibrate the persona to refine personality traits
   - Adjust influence weights to control how personality, knowledge, and document context affect responses

2. **Generate Initial Document**
   - Use the "Generate Draft" button to create a document based on the persona and knowledge base
   - Use "Generate from Prompt" to create content based on specific instructions (e.g., "Write about your achievements")

3. **Edit with Context**
   - Select segments of the document to edit
   - Provide editing instructions (e.g., "Emphasize the South African context")
   - The AI edits the segment considering:
     - The persona's traits, values, and expertise
     - Relevant information from the knowledge base
     - The context of the entire document

4. **Rate and Improve**
   - Rate each edit to help the system learn preferences
   - Provide detailed feedback on what worked well or poorly
   - Use analytics to track improvement over time

## Technical Implementation

### Services
- **DocumentEditingService**: Handles segment-based editing with persona and knowledge integration
- **StructuredDocumentService**: Manages structured documents and section-based editing
- **PersonaSynthesisService**: Creates personas from documents (extracts basic information)
- **PersonaCalibrationService**: Refines persona traits, values, and decision-making framework with influence weighting controls
- **KnowledgeProcessingService**: Processes and analyzes uploaded documents
- **FeedbackDrivenImprovementService**: Tracks ratings and improves future suggestions

### Components
- **SegmentEditor**: UI for selecting and editing document segments
- **SectionEditor**: UI for editing structured document sections
- **PersonaManager**: Interface for creating, calibrating, and managing personas with weighting controls
- **PersonaWeightsControl**: Interface for adjusting persona influence weights
- **ControlPanel**: Knowledge base management and persona selection
- **DocumentEditor**: Main editing interface with segment and section selection
- **DocumentVersionHistory**: Tracks document evolution through versions
- **FeedbackPanel**: Controls for rating and refining documents

## Difference Between Synthesis and Calibration

- **Synthesis**: The process of creating an initial persona from documents by extracting basic information such as name, role, and biography.
- **Calibration**: The process of refining a persona's personality traits, values, communication style, decision-making framework, and behavioral patterns to make the persona more consistent and authentic.

## Future Enhancements
- Enhanced document structure analysis
- Collaborative editing features
- Export options for personas and documents
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external knowledge sources
